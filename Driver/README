This driver is intended for a Wiener MPOD Crate running HV power supplies. 
It has been partially tested on the following modules: 
- EHS 84 60n
- EHS 84 40p
- EHS 84 20n

This (Work in Progress) driver is meant to provide access to functionalities not available in stock programs or GUIs. 

Resources used to develop this driver package: 
- SNMP documentation
- Iseg SNMP Programmers Guide
- Wiener MPOD HV&LV Power Supply System Technical Manual
- FSU's guide at https://fsunuc.physics.fsu.edu/wiki/index.php/Python_Iseg_HV_controller
